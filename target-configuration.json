/*
	Mercenary Target Configuration File
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Host is required, as this value that will be sent during registration for
	tasks to be assigned to the target.  In the absense of a value for 'port',
	the default for target is '6464'.

	A registration url is optional.  However, if none is found then the target
	will not show up on the dashboard of any server, and any task sent to the
	target will be required to provide a uri to report it's results to.

	The environment section is optional, but will allow the server to only send
	task assignments that requires the environment provided.  These key/value
	pairs can be any string value, as they are not validated, only used to do
	environment matches.

	The plugins section is not optional.  The target will only complete tasks
	using plugins for which a valid configuration exists.  However, key-value
	pairs are not required unless dictated by the plugin or to modify a
	default value.
