	Mercenary Target Task Assignment Payload
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The type value will be used to find the right plugin to use to accomplish
	the task.  However, the entire payload should be sent to the plugin.

	The task-plugin-type key is a placeholder for an actual plugin, and should
	be replaced (e.g., "ranorex").  This is the part that will be used by the
	plugin to know how to execute the task.

	Report plugin specific key-value pairs can also be sent along with each
	task, and will be returned - unchanged - along with the task execution
	result.
